\fBsynergys\fR \fB --version\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Starts the \fBsynergys\fR mouse/keyboard
sharing server. By default \fBsynergys\fR runs in the
background and restarts on failure.
.PP
\fBSynergy\fR lets you use one keyboard and
mouse across multiple computers. To do so it requires that all
the computers are connected to each other via TCP/IP
networking. Most systems come with this installed.
.PP
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-a \fIaddress\fB --address \fIaddress\fB \fR
listen for clients on the given address.

The argument for --address is of the form:
[\fIhostname\fR][:\fIport\fR].
The hostname must be the address or hostname of an
interface on the system.  The default is to listen on all
interfaces.  The port overrides the default port, 24800.
.TP
\fB-c \fIpathname\fB --config \fIpathname\fB \fR
use the named configuration file instead.

If no configuration file pathname is provided then the first of the
following to load sets the configuration:
.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fI~/.synergy.conf\fR
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fI/etc/synergy.conf\fR
.RE

If no configuration file can be loaded then the
configuration uses its defaults with just the server
screen.
.TP
\fB--enable-crypto \fR
enables encryption. Clients will fail to connect if the server does
not find a key. Synergy looks for a key at 
\fI<profile-dir>/SSL/Synergy.pem\fR
Generate a key with the Setup Wizard in \fBsynergy\fR or the
script \fI/usr/share/synergy/gen_ssl_pem.sh\fR\&.
.TP
\fB--enable-drag-drop \fR
ignored option. Drag and drop is not supported on linux.
.TP
\fB-d \fIlevel\fB --debug \fIlevel\fB \fR
filter out log messages with priority below
\fIlevel\fR\&.

Debug levels are from highest to lowest: FATAL, ERROR,
WARNING, NOTE, INFO, DEBUG, DEBUG1, and DEBUG2.  Only
messages at or above the given level are logged.  Messages
are logged to a terminal window when running in the
foreground, and to syslog when running as a daemon.
.TP
\fB--display \fIdisplay\fB \fR
connect to the X server at \fIdisplay\fR
.TP
\fB--daemon \fR
run the server as a daemon.
.TP
\fB-f --no-daemon \fR
run the server in the foreground.
.TP
\fB-l \fIlog-file\fB --log \fIlog-file\fB \fR
write log messages to \fIlog-file\fR
.TP
\fB-n \fIscreen-name\fB --name \fIscreen-name\fB \fR
use \fIscreen-name\fR instead of
the hostname to identify this screen in the
configuration.

This option lets the client use
a name other than its hostname for its screen.
.TP
\fB--no-tray\fR
disable the system tray icon.
.TP
\fB--no-xinitthreads\fR
disable Xlib threading support.

This option may fix some crashing issues with Synergy.
.TP
\fB--restart \fR
restart the server automatically if it fails.
.TP
\fB-1 --no-restart \fR
do not try to restart the server if it fails for some reason.
.TP
\fB--profile-dir \fIpath\fB \fR
specify an alternate profile directory \fIpath\fR\&.
Default is ~/.synergy/
.TP
\fB--plugin-dir \fIpath\fB \fR
specify an alternate plugin directory \fIpath\fR\&.
Default is ~/.synergy/plugins/
.TP
\fB-h --help \fR
display help and exit.
.TP
\fB--version \fR
display version information and exit.
.SH "CONFIGURING THE SERVER"
.PP
The synergy server requires configuration. Example
configurations are available in
\fI/usr/share/doc/synergy/examples\fR
The configuration file is a plain text file broken
into sections. Each section has the form:

.nf
      section: <name>
      \~\~<args>
      end
    
.fi
.PP
Comments are introduced by `#' and continue to the end of the
line.  The file can have the following sections.  The `screens'
section must appear before the `links' and `aliases' sections.
.SS "SCREENS"
.PP
<args> is a list of screen names, one name per line,
each followed by a colon.  Names are arbitrary strings but
they must be unique.  The hostname of each computer is
recommended.  There must be a screen name for the server and
each client.  Each screen can specify a number of options.
Options have the form `name = value' and a listed one per line
after the screen name.
.PP
Example:

.nf
        section: screens
        \~\~moe: 
        \~\~larry:
        \~\~\~\~halfDuplexCapsLock = true
        \~\~\~\~halfDuplexNumLock = true
        \~\~curly:
        \~\~\~\~meta = alt
        end
      
.fi
.PP
This declares three screens named: moe, larry, and curly.
Screen `larry' has half-duplex caps lock and num lock keys
(see below) and screen `curly' converts the meta modifier key
to the alt key.
.PP
Screen can have the following options:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
halfDuplexCapsLock = {true|false}

This computer has a caps lock key that doesn't report a
press and a release event when the user presses it but
instead reports a press event when it's turned on and a
release event when it's turned off.  If caps lock acts
strangely on all screens then you may need this option on
the server screen.  If it acts strangely on one screen
then that screen may need the option.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
halfDuplexNumLock = {true|false}

This is identical to halfDuplexCapsLock except it applies
to the num lock key.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
xtestIsXineramaUnaware = {true|false}

This option works around a bug in the XTest extension when
used in combination with Xinerama.  It affects X11 clients
only.  Not all versions of the XTest extension are aware
of the Xinerama extension.  As a result, they do not move
the mouse correctly when using multiple Xinerama screens.
This option is currently true by default.  If you know
your XTest extension is Xinerama aware then set this
option to false.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Modifier keys:

shift = {shift|ctrl|alt|meta|super|none}

ctrl  = {shift|ctrl|alt|meta|super|none}

alt   = {shift|ctrl|alt|meta|super|none}

meta  = {shift|ctrl|alt|meta|super|none}

super = {shift|ctrl|alt|meta|super|none}

Map a modifier key pressed on the server's keyboard to a
different modifier on this client.  This option only has
an effect on a client screen; it's accepted and ignored on
the server screen.

You can map, say, the shift key to shift (the default),
ctrl, alt, meta, super or nothing.  Normally, you wouldn't
remap shift or ctrl.  You might, however, have an X11
server with meta bound to the Alt keys.  To use this
server effectively with a windows client, which doesn't
use meta but uses alt extensively, you'll want the windows
client to map meta to alt (using `meta = alt').
.SS "LINKS"
.PP
<args> is a list of screen names just like in the
`screens' section except each screen is followed by a list
of links, one per line.  Each link has the form
`<left|right|up|down> = <name>\&'.  A link
indicates which screen is adjacent in the given direction.
.PP
Example:

.nf
        section: links 
        moe:
        \~\~right = larry
        \~\~up\~\~\~\~= curly
        larry:
        \~\~left  = moe
        \~\~up\~\~\~\~= curly
        curly:
        \~\~down\~\~= larry
        end
      
.fi
.PP
This indicates that screen `larry' is to the right of screen
`moe' (so moving the cursor off the right edge of moe would
make it appear at the left edge of larry), `curly' is above
`moe', `moe' is to the left of `larry', `curly' is above
`larry', and `larry' is below `curly'.  Note that links do not
have to be symmetrical; moving up from moe then down from
curly lands the cursor on larry.
.SS "ALIASES"
.PP
<args> is a list of screen names just like in the
`screens' section except each screen is followed by a list of
aliases, one per line *not* followed by a colon.  An alias is
a screen name and must be unique.  During screen name lookup
each alias is equivalent to the screen name it aliases.  So a
client can connect using its canonical screen name or any of
its aliases.
.PP
Example:

.nf
        section: aliases
        larry:
        \~\~larry.stooges.com
        curly:
        \~\~shemp
        end
      
.fi
.PP
Screen `larry' is also known as `larry.stooges.com' and can
connect as either name.  Screen `curly' is also known as
`shemp'.  (Hey, it's just an example.)
.SS "OPTIONS"
.PP
<args> is a list of lines of the form `name =
value'. These set the global options.
.PP
Example:

.nf
        section: options
        \~heartbeat = 5000
        \~switchDelay = 500
        end
      
.fi
.PP
You can use the following options:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
heartbeat = N

The server will expect each client to send a message no
less than every N milliseconds.  If no message arrives
from a client within 3N seconds the server forces that
client to disconnect.

If synergy fails to detect clients disconnecting while the
server is sleeping or vice versa, try using this option.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
switchDelay = N

Synergy won't switch screens when the mouse reaches the
edge of a screen unless it stays on the edge for N
milliseconds.  This helps prevent unintentional switching
when working near the edge of a screen.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
switchDoubleTap = N

Synergy won't switch screens when the mouse reaches the
edge of a screen unless it's moved away from the edge and
then back to the edge within N milliseconds.  With the
option you have to quickly tap the edge twice to switch.
This helps prevent unintentional switching when working
near the edge of a screen.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
screenSaverSync = {true|false}

If set to false then synergy won't synchronize screen
savers.  Client screen savers will start according to
their individual configurations.  The server screen saver
won't start if there is input, even if that input is
directed toward a client screen.
.PP
The synergy server will try certain pathnames to load the
configuration file if the user doesn't specify a path using
the `--config' command line option.  `synergys --help' reports
those pathnames.
.SH "RUNNING THE SERVER"
.PP
Run the server on the computer that has the keyboard and mouse
to be shared.  You must have prepared a configuration file
before starting the server.  The server should be started before
the clients but that's not required.
.PP
Run the synergy server on the server system using the following
command line:

\fBsynergys\fR \fB -f\fR [ \fB--config \fIconfig-pathname\fB\fR ]

.PP
Replace \fIconfig-pathname\fR with the path
to the configuration file. See OPTIONS for the default locations
of the configuration file.  The `-f' option causes synergys to
run in the foreground.  This is recommended until you've
verified that the configuration works.  If you didn't include
the system's hostname in the configuration file (either as a
screen name or an alias) then you'll have to add `--name
\fIscreen-name\fR\&' to the command line,
where \fIscreen-name\fR is a name in the
configuration file. You can use `synergys --help' for a list of
command line options.
.PP
See `Starting Automatically on Unix' below for running synergy
automatically when the X server starts.
.SH "CONFIGURE SYNERGY TO START AUTOMATICALLY"
.PP
Synergy requires an X server. That means a server must be
running and synergy must be authorized to connect to that
server. It's best to have the display manager start
synergy. You'll need the necessary (probably root) permission to
modify the display manager configuration files. If you don't
have that permission you can start synergy after logging in via
the .xsession file.
.PP
To start the server use something like:

\fBkillall \fR \fBsynergys\fR


\fBsynergys\fR [ \fB<options>\fR ] \fB --config <config-pathname>\fR

.PP
<options> must not include `-f' or `--no-daemon'.  If the
configuration pathname is one of the default locations then you
don't need the `--config' option.
.PP
Note that some display managers (xdm and kdm, but not gdm) grab
the keyboard and do not release it until the user logs in, for
security reasons.  This prevents a synergy server from sharing
the mouse and keyboard until the user logs in.
.SH "ENABLING CRYPTO"
.PP
By default, \fBsynergys\fR does not secure its
communications in any way. This is dangerous, as all clipboard
and mouse and keyboard events (e.g. typed passwords) are easily
examined by anyone listening on the network.
.PP
To turn on encryption and authentication support, use
the \fB--enable-crypto\fR option on both client and
server. The server must also have a private key and certificate
which are generated by \fBsynergy\fR\&'s setup wizard.
Debian also includes a script at
\fI/usr/share/synergy/gen_ssl_pem.sh\fR
to generate a private key, certificate and fingerprint. The fingerprint
located in \fI~/.synergy/SSL/Fingerprints/Local.txt\fR
is used for verifying the client's connection. It must be added
to the client's trusted servers list before the
\fBsynergyc\fR will connect to the server.
.PP
If this level of security is not sufficient for some reason you
can use SSH (secure shell) to provide strong authentication and
encryption to synergy.  SSH is available on Debian systems in
the "openssh-server" and "openssh-client" packages, or from
http://www.openssh.com/.  On Windows you can use the Cygwin
version of OpenSSH.

\fBssh \fR \fB-f\fR \fB-N\fR \fB-L
 24800:\fIserver-hostname\fB:24800
\fR \fB\fIserver-hostname\fB\fR

.PP
where \fIserver-hostname\fR is the name or
address of the SSH and synergy server host.  24800 is the
default synergy port; replace it with whichever port you use if
you don't use the default.  Once ssh authenticates with the
server, start the synergy client as usual except use `localhost'
or `127.0.0.1' for the server address.  Synergy will then pass
all communication through SSH which encrypts it, passes it over
the network, decrypts it, and hands it back to synergy.
Authentication is provided by SSH's authentication.
