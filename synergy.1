.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBsynergy\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBsynergy\fR command starts
a graphical interface for setting up Synergy client or server 
sessions, allowing the mouse and keyboard from one computer 
to control multiple computers as if they were a single multi-
monitor system.
.PP
The \fBsynergy\fR tool has some 
configuration limitations compared to text config. 
It cannot define non-reciprocal display connections.
Configurations are limited to a 3x5 grid. Text configuration 
allows for offset displays and one-to-many edges.
.PP
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
