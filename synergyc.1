\fBsynergyc\fR \fB --version\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Starts the \fBsynergyc\fR mouse/keyboard 
sharing client. By default \fBsynergyc\fR runs in the
background and restarts on failure.
.PP
\fBSynergy\fR lets you use one keyboard and
mouse across multiple computers. To do so it requires that all
the computers are connected to each other via TCP/IP
networking. Most systems come with this installed.
.PP
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB--enable-crypto \fR
enables encryption. \fBsynergyc\fR verifies the server
fingerprint matches one available in
\fI~/.synergy/SSL/Fingerprints/TrustedServers.txt\fR
.TP
\fB--enable-drag-drop \fR
ignored option. Drag and drop is not supported on linux.
.TP
\fB-d \fIlevel\fB --debug \fIlevel\fB \fR
use debugging level \fIlevel\fR\&.

Debug levels are from highest to lowest:  FATAL,
ERROR, WARNING, NOTE, INFO, DEBUG, DEBUG1, and DEBUG2.
Only messages at or above the given level are logged.
Messages are logged to a terminal window when running in
the foreground, and to syslog when running as a daemon.
.TP
\fB--display \fIdisplay\fB \fR
connect to the X server at \fIdisplay\fR
.TP
\fB--daemon \fR
run the client as a daemon.
.TP
\fB-f --no-daemon \fR
run in client the foreground.
.TP
\fB-l \fIlog-file\fB --log \fIlog-file\fB \fR
write log messages to \fIlog-file\fR
.TP
\fB-n \fIscreen-name\fB --name \fIscreen-name\fB \fR
use \fIscreen-name\fR instead of
the hostname.

This option lets the client use a name other than its
hostname for its screen. This name is used when checking
the configuration.
.TP
\fB--no-tray\fR
disable the system tray icon.
.TP
\fB--no-xinitthreads\fR
disable Xlib threading support.

This option may fix some crashing issues with Synergy.
.TP
\fB--restart \fR
restart the client automatically if it fails.
.TP
\fB-1 --no-restart \fR
do not try to restart the client if it fails for some
reason.
.TP
\fB          --yscroll \fIdelta\fB \fR
set the vertical scrolling delta to
\fIdelta\fR\&.  If this option is not
given, the default vertical scrolling delta is 120.
.TP
\fB          --profile-dir \fIpath\fB \fR
specify an alternate profile directory
\fIpath\fR\&. Default is
~/.synergy/
.TP
\fB          --plugin-dir \fIpath\fB \fR
specify an alternate plugin directory
\fIpath\fR\&. Default is
~/.synergy/plugins/
.TP
\fB-h --help \fR
display help and exit.
.TP
\fB--version \fR
display version information and exit.
.TP
\fB\fIaddress\fB \fR
address of server.

\fIaddress\fR has one of the
following forms:
.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fIhostname\fR
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fIhostname\fR:\fIport\fR
.RE

\fIhostname\fR is a hostname or
address of a network interface on the server
system. \fIport\fR is a port number
from 1 to 65535.  \fIport\fR defaults
to 24800.
.SH "RUNNING THE CLIENT"
.PP
Run the client on all computers that aren't the server using
the following command line:

\fBsynergyc\fR \fB-f\fR \fB-1\fR \fB\fIserver-hostname\fB\fR

Replace \fIserver-hostname\fR with the
hostname or address of the server system. The `-f' option causes
synergy to run in the foreground. The `-1' option causes synergy
to exit on failure. These options are recommended until
you've verified that the configuration works.
If you didn't include the system's
hostname in the configuration file (either as a screen name or
an alias) then you'll have to add `--name
\fIscreen-name\fR\&' to the command line,
where \fIscreen-name\fR is a name in the
configuration file.
.PP
The client should quickly report `connected to server'.  If it
does not but doesn't print an error and exit immediately then
it's trying to connect to the server but cannot.  It will time
out in 30 seconds and exit (use ctrl+c to exit earlier).  You
should check that the server is running and is reachable over
the network and try again.
.PP
If the client fails and exits it should print an error describing
the problem.  Here are typical problems and possible solutions:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
failed to open screen:

check permission to open the X display

check that the DISPLAY environment variable is set
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
already connected:

check that the synergy client isn't already running
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
refused client:

add client to the server's configuration file
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
connection failed:

check \fIserver-hostname\fR

the server cannot open the desired port, stop the
program using that port (24800) and restart the
server
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
failed to verify server certificate fingerprint:

A matching fingerprint for the server was not found in 
the client's \fI~/.synergy/SSL/Fingerprints/TrustedServers.txt\fR
.PP
Once all the clients are running, try moving the mouse to each
screen.  Be sure to check all the configured links. 
.SH "ENABLING CRYPTO"
.PP
To connect to a synergy server with crypto enabled the client
must have the server's fingerprint in its trusted servers list:
\fI~/.synergy/SSL/Fingerprints/TrustedServers.txt\fR\&.
Run the client with the `--enable-crypto' option.
.SH "STARTING AUTOMATICALLY"
.PP
Synergy requires an X server.  That means a server must be
running and synergy must be authorized to connect to that server.
I recommend to start the synergy client from a start script
of your desktop environment or window manager. The commands
should look something like this:

\fBpkill synergyc\fR


\fBsynergyc\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ] \fB\fIserver-hostname\fB\fR

.PP
If you are using GNOME, you can add the synergy client to the
list of the non-session-managed startup programs. For doing this,
start the control center, choose `Session Properties & Startup'
and then `Startup Programs'. Add a new entry with `\fB/usr/bin/synergyc
\fIserver-hostname\fB\fR\&' as the startup command.
.PP
\fIoptions\fR must not include `-f' or `--no-daemon'.
It's important to make sure no old copies of synergy are running so they
can't interfere with the new one.
